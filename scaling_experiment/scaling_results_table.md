## Key Observations

1. **RF** shows excellent performance on small systems (N ≤ 25) with competitive AUROC and AUPRC scores
2. **StructureFlow** maintains good performance across all system sizes but scales poorly in training time
3. **NGM-NODE** performs well on small systems but becomes computationally prohibitive for N > 100
4. **RF training time** scales very favorably, remaining under 20 seconds even for N=500
5. **Performance degradation** with system size is most pronounced for RF, while StructureFlow maintains more consistent performance

## Method Comparison

| Method | Best Performance | Scaling | Training Time |
|--------|------------------|---------|---------------|
| StructureFlow | Good across all sizes | Consistent | Poor (O(N²)) |
| NGM-NODE | Excellent on small systems | Poor (N ≤ 100) | Very poor |
| RF | Excellent on small systems | Poor | Excellent (O(N)) |
